These are just some basic automated tasks created using [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/). They are described below.

## Delete Old Labels

I use labels to hang on to emails that I could need again in the immediate future. After months, however, I usually don't still need them. This function deletes emails by label older than a certain threshold (for my use case: 90 days).

## Mark Deleted As Read

Sometimes I delete emails without opening them (you know the type). I run this function periodically to mark all unread deleted emails as read.
